You’ll be joining a team with responsibility for all IT, so you’ll get plenty of variety and will be one of the go-to IT generalists on the team. You will need to be an all-rounder. You’ll need to be ready to support anything from fixing a printer through to writing PowerShell scripts to automate frustrating monotonous tasks. You’ll have full access to systems admin, so you won’t have to escalate through other teams to get your work done. This is a fully on-site position; no hybrid or remote working is offered. You’ll be paid well, with a salary up to £60,000 plus a generous bonus that could be as high as 30-35% of salary if performance is strong. As a global company there could be future opportunity to travel.  It’s expected that this could be the second or third role of your career and you will cover mainly 1st and 2nd line issues. You’ll be sitting directly on the trading floor interacting with traders and fixing issues throughout the day. You will need to have worked in a similar, smaller environment.

Desktop Support Engineer – Hedge Fund – PowerShell Scripting,"No previous financial experience required. This is a technology role, not a finance position. If you’re looking to get into a high-tech Hedge Fund, this is your chance. This is a small, lean team of technologists that you’ll be joining, all of whom are experts in their fields. You’ll be encouraged to learn as much as you possibly can, along with taking as much responsibility for solving issues. It’s the ideal environment for you to join if you like taking the bull by the horns and suggesting new ways of doing things. Of course, you’ll need to ensure your solution is fit for purpose and is tested thoroughly before deploying, but your ideas will be listened to and if you’ve used something before that makes an improvement, your team will want to hear it. You’ll be coming into the end user support team, helping a range of people at the firm, and solving all kinds of their issues. You’ll be responding to various kinds of tickets, and you’ll be encouraged to fulfil every ticket – with support from the team for anything you can’t solve right now. Whether you’re onboarding new users, or solving a complex network performance issue, automation needs to be at the heart of everything you do. This is an extremely efficient technical environment and they’re keen to keep it that way. You’re going to need to have experience in a similar IT Support role in a Microsoft environment, ideally with some Linux. You’ll of course need to have strong PowerShell or Python to automate – you’ll need to show where you’ve done this before at interview, including some form of scripting test. The rest will be down to your approach to problem solving and your ability to work closely with your colleague. There’s no set compensation range here, each offer delivered for each role is based on your situation and your requirements. Your compensation will be split between salary and bonuses and benefits include free food, barista coffee on-site, gym memberships, personal trainer on-site, pension, private healthcare and much more.
